## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(RcppSimdJson)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

##fully set up to load the folder of json files and create 2 new dataframes for questions and trials portion of experiment

test_data_new <- fload("C:\\Users\\beera\\Downloads\\data__2023-02-07T17_07_36.543Z_.json", max_simplify_lvl = "vector")

datafiles <- list.files("C:\\Users\\beera\\Downloads\\Thesis\\JSON_files", pattern='*.json', full.names = TRUE)

trials <- list()
questions <- list()

##only like 6 lines wrong, something with the floading of the datafiles, it shouldn't be datafiles there, alex says structure and ordering is wrong 

i = 1
for (h in 1:length(datafiles)) {
  d <- fload(datafiles[h], max_simplify_lvl ='vector', single_null = NA, empty_array=NA, empty_object=NA)
  for (g in 1:length(d)){
  dat <- d[[g]]
  
  if (is.null(dat$task)){
    next
  }
  
  if (dat$task=='response') {
    trials[[i]] <- as.data.frame(dat)
  } else if (dat$task=='question_response') {
    questions[[i]] <- as.data.frame(dat)
  }
  i = i + 1
  print(i)
 }
}

trials <- do.call(rbind, trials)
questions <- do.call(rbind, questions)

plot(trials$trial_index)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
